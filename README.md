# Kmeans-Clustering
# **Project Title**:-
Analysis and prediction of "Mall_Customers" of american mall market called PHONIX Mall.To find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop.On the basics of prediction of Annual Income vs Spending Score
# Problem Statement:-
The American Finance market as per the GDP of 2011 "PHONIX_TRILLUMS" mall and the first range out of 5.The owner of the mall wants to be exact which particular shop all the products such in different kind of clusters in entire mall.
As a data scientist Engineer predict the futuristic financial market for upcoming GDP rate based on no of clusters
The client want atleast top 5 clusters(shops).

# DISCLAIMER:-
In this paricular dataset we assume Annual income as a centroid and Spending Score from the range 1-100 called as the data nodes of the statement
# **REFERENCES**:-
The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values.The yellow spot represents the "CENTROID" which is max of 3.
# **CONCLUSION**:-
According using Machine Learning Algorithm K means clustering we count that cluster 1 which consists RED colour is a highest cluster which attach more 50 data nodes.
